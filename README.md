# IPCvsClimateVariables
This repository stores the final project for the Introduction to Finances and Enterprises Course of the Data Science Bachelor.

### General Objective

Undertaking a comprehensive analysis to understand the dynamic relationships between various key variables in Mexico and exploring new impact variables that are likely being overlooked due to their low association, as they belong to different areas of interest.

The research focuses on two approaches: first, determining whether climatic conditions, vehicular mobility, and economic performance (IVF) can significantly predict variations in the Price and Quotations Index (IPC in spanish). Second, assessing whether the IPC, the number of cars, and the IVF can serve as predictive indicators for climatic variables.
